# SeamlessCoop Updater

---

## About
This program searches for updates for the Elden Ring SeamlessCoop Mod by LukeYui. If a new release is available, it will be installed automatically. The ersc_settings.ini will be retained.  

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or newer
- Elden Ring installed
- Directory with Elden Ring files has to be ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING`` (default)

## Installation
- Navigate to the latest release on the [releases tab](https://github.com/TheFirstRandom/SeamlessCoopUpdater/releases).
- Download the ``SeamlessCoopUpdater.zip`` file.
- Unzip the archive (any location on your PC will work, for the best clarity I recommend the ``.\ELDEN RING\Game`` directory).
- Open the unzipped ``SeamlessCoop Updater`` directory
- Move the ``update_and_start_ersc.lnk`` to any location you want the modded to run from (likely your desktop).
- Run ``update_and_start_ersc.lnk`` one time to install the mod and detect the current version.
- If you want to launch the modded game and check for updates first, anytime run ``update_and_start_ersc.lnk``.

**Remark:** You can rename the ``update_and_start_ersc.lnk`` if you want to.

## Notes
If something isn't working you can open an issue on [the issues tab](https://github.com/TheFirstRandom/SeamlessCoopUpdater/issues).
