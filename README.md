# SeamlessCoop Updater

---

## About
This program searches for updates for the Elden Ring SeamlessCoop Mod by LukeYui. If a new release is available, it will be installed automatically. The ersc_settings.ini will be retained.  

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or newer
- Elden Ring installed
- Directory with Elden Ring files has to be ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game`` (default)

## Installation
- Navigate to the latest release on the [releases tab](https://github.com/TheFirstRandom/SeamlessCoopUpdater/releases).
- Download the ``SeamlessCoopUpdater.zip`` file.
- Unzip the archive (any location on your PC will work, for the best clarity I recommend the ``.\ELDEN RING\Game`` directory).
- Open the unzipped ``SeamlessCoopUpdater`` directory.
- Run ``ersc_updater.exe`` one time to install the mod and detect the current version.
- If you want to launch the modded game and check for updates first, anytime run ``ercs_updater.exe``.

**Remark:** You can [create a link](https://www.minitool.com/lib/lnk-file.html) to the ``ersc_updater.exe`` file on your desktop.

## Notes
If something isn't working, you can open an issue on [the issues tab](https://github.com/TheFirstRandom/SeamlessCoopUpdater/issues).
